\chapter{Experimental Methodology}
\label{ch:method}

This chapter covers the methodology by introducing each experimental component
and its implementation details.  This has been split into four sections, which
correspond to the four steps summarized in Figure \ref{fig:method}.

Section \ref{sec:training} discusses how the training data set is obtained
through simulations and computational means. The initial training data
simulated via \gls{ORIGEN} is detailed in Section \ref{sec:training} This
provides a set of \gls{SNF} observations with known reactor operation
parameters, i.e., labels that are to be predicted.  

Next, the information reduction step is covered in Section \ref{sec:inforeduc},
where random error is injected or computational gamma spectra are created via
the \gls{GADRAS} tool.  After this, the less-precise training data sets will be
input to a statistical learner for the next step: training models.

Section \ref{sec:statmodel} covers the implementation of the algorithms
introduced in \ref{sec:algs}. They use the features and labels in the training
data sets to formulate a model. 

Lastly, the algorithms must be evaluated for their prediction performance when
given test samples (i.e., a new \gls{SNF} measurement that has no labels
according the to algorithm).  The approach is shown in Section \ref{sec:eval}.

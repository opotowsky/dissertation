\chapter{Experimental Methodology}
\label{ch:method}

This chapter covers the methodology by introducing each experimental component.
This has been split into three sections, which cover the four steps summarized
in Figure \ref{fig:method}.

Section \ref{sec:training} discusses how the training data set is obtained
through simulations and computational means. The initial training data
simulated via \gls{ORIGEN} is detailed in Section \ref{sec:snfsim} This
provides a set ofi \gls{SNF} observations with known reactor operation
parameters, i.e., labels that are to be predicted.  Next, the information
reduction step is covered in Section \ref{sec:inforeduc}, where random error is
injected or computational gamma spectra are created via the \gls{GADRAS} tool.
After this, the less-precise data set will be input to a statistical learner
for the next step: training a model.

Section \ref{sec:statmodel} covers the implementation of the algorithms
introduced in \ref{sec:algs}. They use the features and labels in the training
data to formulate a model. \todo[inline]{update needed} 

Lastly, the algorithms must be evaluated for their prediction performance when
given test samples (i.e., a new \gls{SNF} measurement that has no labels
according the to algorithm).  The approach is shown in Section \ref{sec:eval}.

Hi hello.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

Thus, ultimately, this research protocol is designed to answer the question
\textit{How does the ability to determine forensic-relevant spent nuclear fuel
attributes using machine-learning techniques degrade as less information is
available?}. 

Mll performs well bc of training set design. If there were to be a smaller db
with higher simulation fidelity, other algs may do better because there would
be fewer training set entries. Even a few times throughout this work, knn and
dec trees gets close to MLL performance.

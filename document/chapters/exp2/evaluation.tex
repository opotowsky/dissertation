The prediction performance is measured by the balanced accuracy of the reactor
type classification or the absolute and/or relative error of the regression
cases (burnup, \gls{U235} enrichment, cooling time), which were introduced in
Section \ref{sec:testerr}.  These performance metrics for all four prediction
types and all six detectors are compared across the three algorithms used:
\textit{k}-nearest neighbors (denoted in plots as \textit{kNN}), decision trees
(denoted in plots as \textit{Dec Tree} or \textit{DTree}), and \gls{MLL}
calculations.  In all of the results in this section, the statistics being
reported is on all $4.5 \times 10^5$ entries in the training set.

In order to evaluate the prediction performance degradation with decreasing
information quality via detector energy resolution, a basic plot format is
presented, pictured in Figure \ref{fig:detdemo}.  There are three plots for
each prediction parameter, corresponding to the three energy window lists:
auto, short, and long.  The vertical axis is always oriented so that higher
levels indicate better performance, so is plotted as accuracy score or negative
error.  

The horizontal axis is oriented so that reduced information travels rightward.
First, the 29 nuclide mass training set is included for comparison, followed by
the 32 nuclide activity training set, which is intended to represent a full
knowledge scenario of nuclide activities before gamma detection. These are both
the same for all three energy window lists.  The 7 \& 12 nuclide activities are
next, and they represent the full knowledge scenario for the post-gamma
detection short and long energy window lists, respectively.  So if a window is
presenting the short energy window list results, it will include the data point
from the 7 nuclide activity training set; the long energy window list results
present the 12 nuclide activities results. The 12 nuclide activity training set
is used for the auto energy window list plots, but it is not possible to know
which set best represents the auto results since the peak search approach does
not take physics into account and it varies across detectors. All of the
nuclide mass/nuclide activity training sets are predicted with a 1\% training
set error applied, so that there is a non-zero but low error estimate mimicking
near-perfect information.  Last, the six detectors are in order of decreasing
detector energy resolution. Thus, for each prediction parameter, there are
three plots for each energy window list with these nine horizontal axis
categories. 

The last component of Figure \ref{fig:detdemo} is the red horizontal line.  It
represents a minimum acceptable performance, interpreted from the results in
Section \ref{sec:eval1}. It is drawn at the level of the worst performing
algorithm at 20\% training set error.  This is therefore somewhat arbitrary,
but if the detectors cannot predict above this level, it means that a
detector-based training set with only counting error cannot reach the level of
performance of 20\% error in a training set based on an assay of 29 nuclide
masses.

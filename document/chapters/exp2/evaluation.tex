The prediction performance is measured by the balanced accuracy of the reactor
type classification or the absolute and/or relative error of the regression
cases (burnup, \gls{U235} enrichment, cooling time), which were introduced in
Section \ref{sec:testerr}.  These performance metrics for all four prediction
types and all six detectors are compared across the three algorithms used:
\textit{k}-nearest neighbors (denoted in plots as \textit{kNN}), decision trees
(denoted in plots as \textit{Dec Tree} or \textit{DTree}), and \gls{MLL}
calculations.  \todo[inline]{how much gets repeated from ch 3, e.g.,
reexplaining balanced accuracy, confusion matrices, etc?}

In order to evaluate the prediction performace degradation with decreasing
information quality via detector energy resolution, a basic plot format is
presented, pictured in Figure \ref{fig:detdemo}. The \textit{y}-axis is always
oriented so that higher levels indicate better performance, so is plotted as
accuracy score or negative error.  The \textit{x}-axis is oriented so that
degradation travels rightward. There are three plots for each prediction
parameter, corresponding to the three energy window lists: auto, short, and
long.  First, the 29 nuclide mass training set is included for comparison,
followed by the 32 nuclide activity training set, which is intended to
represent a full knowledge scenario of nuclide activities before gamma
detection. These are both the same for all three energy window lists.  The 7 \&
12 nuclide activities are next, and they represent the full knowledge scenario
for the post-gamma detection short and long energy window lists, respectively.
The 12 nuclide activity training set is chosen to be used for the auto energy
window list plots.  All of the nuclide mass/nuclide activity training sets are
predicted with a 1\% training set error applied.  Last, the six detectors are
in order of decreasing detector energy resolution. Thus, for each prediction
parameter, there are three plots for each energy window list with these nine
\textit{x}-axis categories.

Another component of Figure \ref{fig:detdemo} are the two horizontal lines. The
bottom/red line represents some measure of minimum acceptable "base level"
performance.  Depending on the metric being presented, this is derived from the
training set composition or the performance of the 29 nuclide mass training set
in Section \ref{sec:eval1}. The top/blue line represents the ideal performance,
and is also determined either from the training set design or previous
performance with the 29 nuclide mass training set.

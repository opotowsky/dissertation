\chapter{Reactor Parameter Prediction Using Processed Gamma Spectra}
\label{ch:exp2}

This chapter covers the parameter prediction workflow using processed spectra
as the input features. First, the methodology is updated from that in Chapter
\ref{ch:exp1} in four sections that correspond to the four steps summarized in
Figure \ref{fig:method}.  The fifth section presents and discusses the results.

Section \ref{sec:training2} updates the features used in the training set. The
full description of the simulations and training labels can be found in Section
\ref{sec:training1}.  This provides a set of \gls{SNF} observations with the
same known reactor operation parameters, i.e., labels that are to be predicted,
but new nuclide features.

Next, the information reduction step is covered in Section
\ref{sec:inforeduc2}.  Here, computational gamma spectra are created via the
\gls{GADRAS} tool; six detectors with decreasing energy resolution were chosen.
The approach for processing the spectra from these detectors is outlined here
as well. 

The increasingly less-precise training data sets are input to a statistical
learner for the next step: training models.  These use the features (from
processed spectra) and labels (reactor parameters/simulation inputs) in the
training data sets to formulate a model.  This is introduced in Section
\ref{sec:statmodel1}, and the updates for this experiment are in Section
\ref{sec:statmodel2}. 

Lastly, the algorithms must be evaluated for their prediction performance when
given test samples (i.e., a new \gls{SNF} measurement that has no labels
according the to algorithm).  This follows much of what was introduced in
Section \ref{sec:eval1}, and the updates to the approach is shown in Section
\ref{sec:eval2}.

\chapter{Reactor Parameter Prediction Using Processed Gamma Spectra}
\label{ch:exp2}

This chapter covers the parameter prediction workflow using processed spectra
as the input features. The methodology from Chapter \ref{ch:exp1} is reapplied
with new implementations surrounding the training set moving beyond full
knowledge of nuclide masses to degraded knowledge of processed gamma spectra.
This is described in four sections that correspond to the four steps summarized
in Figure \ref{fig:method}. 

The full description of the simulations and training labels can be found in
Section \ref{sec:training1}.  Section \ref{sec:training2} provides the updates
on the features used in the training set.  This results in a set of \gls{SNF}
observations with the same known reactor operation parameters, i.e., labels
that are to be predicted, but new nuclide features. 

Next, the information reduction step is covered in Section
\ref{sec:inforeduc2}.  Here, computational gamma spectra are created via the
\gls{GADRAS} tool; six detectors with decreasing energy resolution were chosen.
The approach for processing the spectra from these detectors is outlined here
as well. 

The increasingly less-precise training data sets are input to a statistical
learner for the next step: training models.  These use the features (from
processed spectra) and labels (reactor parameters/simulation inputs) in the
training data sets to formulate a model.  This is introduced in Section
\ref{sec:statmodel1}, and the updates for this experiment are in Section
\ref{sec:statmodel2}. 

Lastly, the algorithms must be evaluated for their prediction performance when
given test samples (i.e., a new \gls{SNF} measurement that has no labels
according the to algorithm).  This follows much of what was introduced in
Section \ref{sec:eval1}, and the updates to the approach is shown in Section
\ref{sec:eval2}.

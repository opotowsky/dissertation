To judge the degradation of predictions of the algorithms with decreasing
information quality (detailed in Section \ref{sec:inforeduc2}), a plot for each
energy window list (auto, short, and long) is made.  Figure \ref{fig:rxtr}
shows the balanced accuracy of reactor type classification for the previously
described \textit{x}-axis, where a score of $1$ is perfect prediction and a
score of $0$ is random classification. The error bars reflect a 99\% confidence
interval. The red line that indicates a baseline/minimum acceptable performance
is at a balanced accuracy score of 0.84, which is based on the lowest
performance of all three algorithms at 20\% training set error for the 29
nuclide mass training set in Figure \ref{fig:randerrA}. The blue line that
indicates an ideal performance is at 0.97 balanced accuracy, which is based on
the approximate performance of all three algorithms at 5\% training set error
for the 29 nuclide mass training set.

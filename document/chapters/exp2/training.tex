In the second experiment, activities of radionuclides are necessary to
calculate gamma spectra from these values. The \gls{ORIGEN} simulations and
their inputs are the same as Section \ref{sec:training1}, but the outputs
tracked are a different set of nuclides, measured in $Ci$, or $Curies$.  In
this experiment, the full knowledge scenario is the set of 32 nuclide
activities found in Table \ref{tbl:nucacts}.  The simulation parameters that
are being predicted are the same:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The classification of the \textbf{reactor type}: \gls{PWR}, \gls{BWR}, 
        or \gls{PHWR}.
  \item The \textbf{burnup}: $MWd/MTU$ or $GWd/MTU$, \textit{mega (or giga) 
        watt-days per metric ton of initial uranium}.
  \item The \gls{U235} \textbf{enrichment}: $\%U235$. 
  \item The \textbf{time since irradiation}, or cooling time: $days$ or $years$.
\end{enumerate}

The second feature set with 32 nuclide activities listed in Table
\ref{tbl:nucacts} was designed with the following reasons in mind. First,
nuclide activities are the most straightforward units to use for application to
the \gls{DRF} in the \gls{GADRAS} tool for the second experiment. This process
is used to obtain gamma spectra for each \gls{SNF} entry in the database, which
is detailed in \ref{sec:inforeduc2}.  Second, these specific nuclides were
chosen because they remained after four steps of filtering:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item They exist in the 196-long radionuclide list in \gls{GADRAS}.
  \item They have an activity above $1e-7\:Ci$ (cutoff chosen to filter out
  nuclides that are unlikely to produce gamma energy peaks).
  \item They have a half-life longer than $1\:year$ (cutoff chosen based on
  maximum time since irradiation of $16\:years$).
  \item They have at least one gamma energy line above $200\:keV$ (cutoff
  chosen based on low-energy gamma energy peaks being difficult to discern in
  some detectors).
\end{enumerate}

\todo[inline]{if shape of feature histograms is relevant, keep the figure and
discuss. update: it isn't relevant for the scikit algorithms, because neither
makes assumptions about the distrubitions of features.}

This one initial training set will undergo several transformations to become
six training sets (one for each detector) for each spectra-processing approach
(three for each set of detectors).  This is described next in Section
\ref{sec:inforeduc2}.

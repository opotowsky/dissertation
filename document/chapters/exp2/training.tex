\todo[inline]{intro, these nucs are chosen because they are radionuclides with
long enough half-lives}

In the second experiment, activities of radionuclides are necessary to
calculate gamma spectra from these values.

The second feature set with the 32 nuclide activities listed in Table
\ref{tbl:nucacts} was designed with the following reasons in mind. First,
nuclide activities are the most straightforward units to use for application to
the \gls{DRF} in the \gls{GADRAS} tool for the second experiment. This process
is used to obtain gamma spectra for each \gls{SNF} entry in the database, which
is detailed in \ref{sec:inforeduc2}.  Second, these specific nuclides were
chosen because they fulfill four steps of filtering:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item They exist in the 196-long radionuclide list in \gls{GADRAS}.
  \item They have an activity above $1e-7\:Ci$ (cutoff chosen to filter out
  nuclides that are unlikely to produce gamma energy peaks).
  \item They have a half-life longer than $1\:year$ (cutoff chosen based on
  maximum cooling time of $16\:years$).
  \item They have at least one gamma energy line above $200\:keV$ (cutoff
  chosen based on low-energy gamma energy peaks being difficult to discern in
  some detectors).
\end{enumerate}

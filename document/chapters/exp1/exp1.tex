\chapter{Reactor Parameter Prediction Using Nuclide Masses}
\label{ch:exp1}

This chapter covers the parameter prediction workflow using nuclide masses as
the input features. First, the methodology is introduced by detailing each
experimental component and its implementation.  This is split into four
sections, which correspond to the four steps summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:method}. The fifth section presents and discusses the results.

Section \ref{sec:training1} discusses how the training data set is obtained
through simulations and computational means. The initial training data
simulated via \gls{ORIGEN} is detailed in Section \ref{sec:training1} This
provides a set of \gls{SNF} observations with known reactor operation
parameters, i.e., labels that are to be predicted. The four labels being
predicted are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The classification of the \textbf{reactor type} is one of the three
  most common commercial power reactors: \gls{PWR}, \gls{BWR}, or \gls{PHWR}.
  \item The \textbf{burnup} describes how much energy was produced by the fuel
  and has the units : $MWd/MTU$ or $GWd/MTU$, \textit{mega (or giga) watt-days
  per metric ton of initial uranium}.
  \item The \textbf{enrichment} is the percentage of \gls{U235} with respect to
  the entire amount of uranium in the fuel: $\%U235$. 
  \item Lastly, the \textbf{time since irradiation}, or cooling time, is
  defined as how long the fuel has been out of the reactor core: $days$ or
  $years$.
\end{enumerate}

Next, the information reduction step is covered in Section
\ref{sec:inforeduc1}, where uniform error is randomly applied. After this, the
less-precise training data sets will be input to a statistical learner for the
next step: training models.

Section \ref{sec:statmodel1} covers the implementation of the algorithms
introduced in \ref{sec:algs}. They use the features and labels in the training
data sets to formulate a model. 

Next, the algorithms must be evaluated for their prediction performance when
given test samples (i.e., a new \gls{SNF} measurement that has no labels
according the to algorithm).  The approach is shown in Section \ref{sec:eval1}.

Lastly, the results are shown in Section \ref{sec:results1} First presented is
the prediction performance of samples that are taken out of the training data
set to be used as test cases, which is shown in Section \ref{sec:results1}.
Second, an external test set with nuclide concentraions is used to show how
this approach performs with real world measurements. This is discussed in
Section \ref{sec:results1}.

As previously introduced in Section \ref{sec:testerr}, the prediction
performance is measured by evaluating the accuracy of the reactor type
classification or the error of the regression cases (burnup, \gls{U235}
enrichment, cooling time).  These performance metrics for all four prediction
types are compared across the three algorithms used: \textit{k}-nearest
neighbors (denoted in plots as \textit{kNN}), decision trees (denoted in plots
as \textit{Dec Tree} or \textit{DTree}), and \gls{MLL} calculations.  

\subsection{Random Error Impacts on Prediction}
\label{sec:randerr}

To judge the degradation of predictions of the algorithms with increasing
nuclide mass measurement error (i.e., reduced information quality, detailed in
Section \ref{sec:inforeduc1}), several plots are made with the introduced error
on the \textit{x}-axis and a prediction performance metric on the
\textit{y}-axis.  The \textit{y}-axis is always oriented so that lower is
poorer performance and higher is better performance. This is why Figures
\ref{fig:randburn}--\ref{fig:randcool} present a negative error on the
\textit{y}-axis. Additionally, the data points on all the plots have a small
$\Delta x$ to show error bars that are otherwise impossible to see.

\subsubsection{Reactor Type Classification}
\label{sec:randerrA}

Figure \ref{fig:randrxtr} shows the balanced accuracy of reactor type
classification, where a score of $1$ is perfect prediction and a score of $0$
is random classification. The error bars reflect a 99\% confidence interval.
While the two scikit-learn algorithms follow a very similar path of decreased
accuracy as the error increases, the \gls{MLL} calculation approach appears to
be more robust to the nuclide mass measurement error.  Another interesting
result is that the \gls{MLL} calculation performs slightly worse for low
errors. If the expected measurement errors of nuclide masses in a training
database or in a test sample can be guaranteed to be better than ~2\%, the
\gls{MLL} calculation is no longer the obvious preferred choice for reactor
type prediction.

  \caption{Prediction performance of reactor type as measured by balanced 
           accuracy with respect to uniform/random error applied to the nuclide 
           mass measurements in the training set.}
  \label{fig:randrxtr}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./chapters/exp1/confusion_matrix_nuc29_3errs.png}
  \caption{Confusion matrices of reactor type prediction for each algorithm 
           at three training set error levels: 1\%, 10\%, and 20\%, in the 
           top, middle, and bottom panels, respectively.}
  \label{fig:cm_nuc29}
\end{figure}

Although the balanced accuracy score provides more information about
classification performance for an imbalanced data set (the training set is
26.8\% \gls{PWR}, 71.6\% \gls{BWR}, and 1.5\% \gls{PHWR}), it still does not
provide much detail about what is being misclassified. To probe this further,
Figure \ref{fig:cm_nuc29} shows three sets of confusion matrices.  The diagonal
squares are the fraction of true positives for each reactor type, where the
predicted label (\textit{x}-axis) is equal to the true label (\textit{y}-axis).
The off diagonal squares are the fraction of false positives for each reactor
type, where the predicted label is something other than the true label.  These
fractions inside the pixels show the raw numbers of each position normalized to
the number of true labels.  It is ideal to have the diagonal be as close to 1
as possible and the off-diagonal pixels be as close to 0 as possible.  In
addition to the fractions being included in the matrices, the raw count values
are also displayed. To allow the fractions to be rapidly perceived, a colorbar
provides perceptually uniform shading for these true positive and false
positive fractions. 

In the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:cm_nuc29}, the three algorithms are
presented for the 1\% random error case. In Figure \ref{fig:randrxtr}, one can
see these three data points on the plot clustered near the top showing
almost-perfect performance.  (A reminder that the true positive fractions in
the confusion matrices do not map directly to the balanced accuracy score,
which puts more weight on the underrepresented classes.) The confusion matrices
give more dimension to this near-perfect reactor type classification
performance. The majority of the misclassification is in \gls{PWR}s being
classified as \gls{BWR}s: 0.4\% for \textit{k}-nearest neighbors and decision
trees, and 1.6\% for \gls{MLL} calculations. Although, there are also some
\gls{BWR}s that are misclassified as \gls{PWR}s: 0.1\% for \textit{k}-nearest
neighbors and decision trees, and 0.5\% for \gls{MLL} calculations.  There are
zero misclassified \gls{PHWR} cases and zero \gls{LWR} cases misclassified as
\gls{PHWR}; the value of 0.000 to three decimals fraction here represents a
real zero-count, but this is not necessarily the case for the other sets of
confusion matrices.  The \gls{PWR}/\gls{BWR} distinction is known to be a
difficult problem, so the correct \gls{PHWR} classifications are not
particularly notable for this discussion. 

The middle panel of Figure \ref{fig:cm_nuc29} shows confusion matrices for the
three algorithms for the 10\% random error case. In Figure \ref{fig:randrxtr},
one can see these three data points on the plot, where the \gls{MLL} point is
near a balanced accuracy score of 1, and the scikit-learn algorithms both have
score of around 0.93. As with the 1\% error case, the majority of the
misclassification is in \gls{PWR}s being classified as \gls{BWR}s: 11.3\% for
\textit{k}-nearest neighbors, 10.3\% for decision trees, and 1.7\% for
\gls{MLL} calculations.  The \gls{BWR}s are being misclassified as \gls{PWR}s
at the following percentages: 3.4\% for \textit{k}-nearest neighbors, 3.6\% for
decision trees, and 0.5\% for \gls{MLL} calculations. Note how the performance
of the \gls{MLL} calculations are nearly the same for both error levels, which
is shown by the \gls{MLL} line in Figure \ref{fig:randrxtr}. Because of the
normalization, the \gls{LWR}s that are misclassified as \gls{PHWR}s appear to
be zero. However, this does happen, just rarely: 15 \gls{BWR}s are classified
as \gls{PHWR} using decision trees. Also, \textit{k}-nearest neighbors and
decision trees misclassified \gls{PHWR} as an \gls{LWR} 2 times using the
former and 20 times using the latter (no \gls{PHWR} misclassifications happened
using \gls{MLL}).

The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:cm_nuc29} shows confusion matrices for the
three algorithms for the 20\% random error case. In Figure \ref{fig:randrxtr},
one can see these three data points on the plot, where the \gls{MLL} point is
near a balanced accuracy score of 0.97, \textit{k}-nearest neighbors is around
0.83, and decision trees is around 0.86. As with the previous two error cases,
the majority of the misclassification is in \gls{PWR}s being classified as
\gls{BWR}s: 24.6\% for \textit{k}-nearest neighbors, 20.3\% for decision trees,
and 5.6\% for \gls{MLL} calculations.  The \gls{BWR}s are being misclassified
as \gls{PWR}s at the following percentages: 7.9\% for \textit{k}-nearest
neighbors, 7.3\% for decision trees, and 0.5\% for \gls{MLL} calculations.
\Gls{PHWR}s are misclassified as an \gls{LWR} 100 times for \textit{k}-nearest
neighbors, 82 times for decision trees, and 0 times for \gls{MLL} calculations.
\Gls{LWR}s were misclassified as \gls{PHWR} 42 times for \textit{k}-nearest
neighbors, 66 times for decision trees, and 0 times for \gls{MLL} calculations.

\subsubsection{Regression Results}
\label{sec:randerrB}

Each set of plots for a given prediction parameter in this section shows both
the relative error (\gls{MAPE}) and the absolute error (\gls{MAE}). In addition
to the \gls{MAE} on the second plot for each regression case, the \gls{MedAE}
is represented as a triangle on the plot as well. These three errors taken
together provide more detailed information about the performance of each
algorithm when faced with training set noise.  As previously mentioned, the
\textit{x}-axis has negative errors, so that higher is always better.

           absolute errors with respect to uniform/random error applied to the 
           nuclide mass measurements in the training set.}
  \label{fig:randburn}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:randburn} demonstrates the burnup prediction performance, with
the \gls{MAPE} in Figure \ref{fig:burnmape} and the \gls{MAE} and \gls{MedAE}
in Figure \ref{fig:burnmae}. In these figures, the error bars reflect one
standard deviation of the percentage errors or the absolute errors,
respectively.  As with the reactor type prediction in Figure
\ref{fig:randrxtr}, the \gls{MLL} method is robust to training set error but
performs slightly worse at low error values.  All three methods calculate
burnup with a maximum error of -5\% or $-1000\:MWd/MTU$ at 20\% error in the
training set. The \gls{MedAE}s show a more encouraging picture of the
performance as compared to the \gls{MAE}s. It is interesting that the
scikit-learn algorithms and the \gls{MLL} calculations diverge at 5\% training
set error for \gls{MAPE} and \gls{MAE}, but at 10\% training set error for the
\gls{MedAE}.

  \label{fig:randenri}
\end{figure}  

Figure \ref{fig:randenri} demonstrates the \gls{U235} enrichment prediction
performance, with the \gls{MAPE} in Figure \ref{fig:enrimape} and the \gls{MAE}
and \gls{MedAE} in Figure \ref{fig:enrimae}. In these figures, the error bars
reflect one standard deviation of the percentage errors or the absolute errors,
respectively.  Again, the \gls{MLL} method is robust to training set error but
performs slightly worse at low error values.  All three methods calculate
enrichment with a maximum error of -6\% or $-0.17\:\%U235$ at 20\% error in the
training set. Again, the \gls{MedAE}s show a more encouraging picture of the
performance as compared to the \gls{MAE}s. The scikit-learn algorithms and the
\gls{MLL} calculations diverge at 10\% training set error for \gls{MAPE} and
\gls{MAE}, but at 15\% training set error for the \gls{MedAE}.

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Prediction performance of time since irradiation as measured by 
           relative and absolute errors with respect to uniform/random error 
           applied to the nuclide mass measurements in the training set.}
  \label{fig:randcool}
\end{figure}

Last, the time since irradiation prediction performance for the three
algorithms with respect to increasing nuclide mass error is pictured in Figure
\ref{fig:randcool}.  The \gls{MAPE} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:enrimape} and
the \gls{MAE} and \gls{MedAE} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:enrimae}.  The error
bars reflect one standard deviation of the percentage errors or the absolute
errors, respectively.  The \gls{MLL} method is most robust to training set
error, but for this prediction parameter, the behavior of \textit{k}-nearest
neighbors is unique here versus the previous two regression categories.  Time
since irradiation is predicted with a maximum error of -30\% or $-550\:days$ at
20\% error in the training set using the \textit{k}-nearest neighbors
algorithm.  In Figure \ref{fig:coolmape}, there is an inset to show more detail
about the behavior of the decision trees and \gls{MLL} calculations curves, so
if one ignores the clearly anomalous \textit{k}-nearest neighbors performance
and focuses instead on decision trees, those values are -6\% and $-120\:days$.
The \gls{MLL} calculations remain nearly horizontal at approximately 2\%
prediction error for all training set error levels.  The \gls{MedAE}, as usual,
shows a more encouraging picture of the performance as compared to the
\gls{MAE}.

Overall, the robustness to training set error that is present in the \gls{MLL}
calculations applies to all of the prediction parameters. The decision trees
performance is second best, and \textit{k}-nearest neighbors performs the
worst.  In the case of time since irradiation, \textit{k}-nearest neighbors
degrades incredibly fast with introduced training set error.  While it is
difficult to draw a baseline for minimum acceptable behavior on these plots,
these performances can serve as a benchmark for the work presented in Chapter
\ref{ch:exp2}.

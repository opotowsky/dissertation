This dissertation would not be possible with the wisdom and patience of my
advisor, Paul Wilson, and the amazing community he fostered, CNERG. Kelly
Burton and Max Lagally both convinced me to remain in graduate school
path---more than once. And Steven ``if you're gonna be dumb you gotta be
tough'' Harrell also kept me in school---more than once, and even after cancer
took him too soon.  

My GERS friends have been with me since the beginning of this journey, especially Robert,
Richard, Chandler, Dinh, Nhi. Much CNERG love to Kalin and Chelsea, who were there in some dark times.

Robin, you have been such a light in my life for over a
decade and always remind me why I came back to grad school.  

Also, Ruthie, you push me to be fierce, spittin' truths and slaying your way
through life.  

Lou, thanks for being one of my best friends and sources of laugh lines. 

For tirelessly encouraging my academic and personal pursuits,
I'm appreciative of my California family, Mel, Bonnie, Joelle, and Jamie. 

Finally, my Madison family has blessed me in countless ways: Shan, Krystal, Ninja, Heather, Burnie, Brarit, James.
